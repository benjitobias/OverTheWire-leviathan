This one was kinda complicated and I googled the final solution.

The process ran access on the file and then system("bin/cat" + sys.argv[1]) (you get the gist).
I tried bypassing is with bp in gdb, no joy. I then tried giving "filename; cat password_file" which ran the command injection but the rights still didn't work.

The trick was to create a file called "pass file.txt" and then a symlink to the pass file called pass.

When passing "pass file.txt" as a param, "access" runs on the "pass file.txt" file returning OK. But then the cat command runs on "pass" and then "file.txt" with the setuid permissions.

Cool trick. Use ltrace to find things, could have helped in 01 too.
